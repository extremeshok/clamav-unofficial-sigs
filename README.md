        be used in any '*.ndb' signature database file

-f, --encode-formatted  Hexadecimal encode a formatted input string containing
        signature spacing fields '{}, (), *', without encoding
        the spacing fields, so that the encoded signature
        can be used in any '*.ndb' signature database file

-g, --gpg-verify        GPG verify a specific Sanesecurity database file
        eg: '-g filename.ext' (do not include file path)

        if the original signature is either modified or removed from
        the third-party signature database

--check-clamav  If ClamD status check is enabled and the socket path is correctly specified
        then test to see if clamd is running or not
