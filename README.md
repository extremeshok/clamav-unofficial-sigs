```bash
clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh --upgrade
clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh
```

### FOR PACKAGE MAINTAINERS / PACKAGERS

Please use the included os.*.conf sample config file as a base for your os.conf, this will disable automatic updates, update notifications and the uninstallation feature. <https://github.com/extremeshok/clamav-unofficial-sigs/tree/master/config/packaging>

### Always Run the script once as your superuser to set all the permissions and create the relevant directories

### Advanced Config Overrides

* Default configs are loaded in the following order if they exist:
* master.conf -> os.conf -> os.*.conf -> user.conf or your-specified.config
* user.conf will always override os.conf and master.conf, os.conf will override master.conf
* please do not alter the master.conf, rather create a user.conf
* A minimum of 1 config is required.
* Specifying a config on the command line (-c | --config) will override the loading of the default configs

#### Check if signature are being loaded

**Run the following command to display which signatures are being loaded by clamav

```clamscan --debug 2>&1 /dev/null | grep "loaded"```

> WARNING - Clamscan reports ________ database integrity tested BAD - SKIPPING

**Run the following command to allow clamav selinux support**
```setsebool -P antivirus_can_scan_system true```
