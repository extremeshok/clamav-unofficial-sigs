This file contains changes to the clamav-unofficial-sigs script written
by Bill Landry (unofficialsigs@gmail.com).  The script provides a simple
way to download, test, and use third-party ClamAV signature databases
provided by Sanesecurity, SecuriteInfo, MalwarePatrol, OITC, etc.

Version 3.7.2 (updated 2013-08-25)
   - Added Sanesecurity signature whitelist "sigwhitelist.ign2" file
     to the list of default databases in the config file.
   - Added "-w" flag to support adding signature whitelist entries in
     "my-whitelist.ign2" file in the newer ClamAV IGN2 format.  Do
     not manually add or remove whitelist entries from this file,
     the script will automatically remove whitelist entries when the
     offending signatures have been modified or removed from the
     third-party database.
   - DEPRECATED the "-b" (signature bypass) flag.  Although still
     supported, it is highly recommend that you instead use the new
     "-w" flag, which supports the newer ClamAV IGN2 signature
     whitelist format.
   - Anchored grep searches when using the "-b" flag in order to
     more exactly match signature searches.  Requested by Paul Wise.
   - Added rsync and curl timeout variables to the configuration
     file to allow the script user to define custom connect and
     overall download timeout values. Requested by Paul Wise.
   - Added a "setmode" variable to the script's configuration file to
     allow the script user to enable or disable the "chmod" command
     usage on the signature files and directory.  Requested by Paul Wise.
   - Added detail to the config file regarding correct file name
     spelling, adding only relevant signature file names to the
     appropriate sections of the config file, and not placing
     anything other than correctly spelled signature file names
     inside the quoted signature name sections of the config file.
   - Modified "add_dbs" section of the script to properly retrieve
     http downloaded signature database files on first-time run.
     Issue reported by Blaine Fleming.
   - Changed script database reporting to reflect the correct author.
   - Updated my contact and script download information in all files
     and updated "man" pages to reflect flag changes and additions.

Version 3.7.1 (updated 2010-06-06)
   - Added the rsync "-r" flag to the "add_dbs" section of the script
     in order to support directory recursion.  Reguested by Jim L.
   - Changed from "host" to "dig" when doing the reverse lookup on the
     Sanesecurity rsync host being used.  The former parse string was
     truncating the last letter of the FQHN on Debian systems.  This
     change removes the final usage of the "host" command from the
     script.  Issue reported by Ralf Hildebrandt.
   - Fixed an issue where corrupted SecuriteInfo databases might be
     created when the signature download site is down or inaccessable.
     The script will now delete SecuriteInfo signature databases from
     the download directory when corruptions issues are detected.
   - Rearranged some logging lines in the MalwarePatrol section of the
     script to resolve an issue with rsyncing files into the ClamAV
     production directory when logging is disabled.  Issue reported
     by Marko Njezic.
   - Updated the SecuriteInfo sections of the script and config files
     to support the new (uncompressed) signature databases.

Version 3.7 (updated 2010-01-23)
   - Removed MSRBL from script as the signature files have not been
     updated since July 2009.  Script users should consider removing
     the MSRBL signature files (MSRBL-Images.hdb & MSRBL-SPAM.ndb)
     from their systems.
   - Rearranged some logging lines in the SecruiteInfo section of the
     script to resolve an issue some were having with rsyncing of files
     into the ClamAV production directory.  Issue reported by Ted S.
   - Removed "+tcp" from the dig command as some sites are blocking
     DNS queries over TCP Port 53.  Added instead the "+ignore"
     flag which will silence the "Truncated" warning when the DNS
     query-response is larger than a single UDP packet can contain.
     This is not an issue since the script initially uses the first
     listed IP address anyway.  Issue reported by Matija Nalis.
   - Replaced "echo -ne" with "printf" when the script is run with
     the "-m" flag, for creating a signature file.  The echo "-e"
     and in some cases "-n" flags are not universally supported by
     all system shells.  Issue reported by Paul Wise.
   - Added new Sanesecurity distributed signature databases and updated
     the risk ratings for all signature databases listed in the config
     file based on info provided at www.sanesecurity.com/databases.htm.

Version 3.6 (updated 2009-08-23)
   - Added "tr" to remove Windows CRLF from signatures in local.ign
     monitoring section.
   - Updated signature database monitoring section to better handle
     rearrangement of signature database file name placement in the
     configuration file.
   - Removed several of the config file reload options in favor of
     simplicity and most reliable options.
   - Changed rsync mirror lookup from 'host' to 'dig' with the hope
     that 'dig' is more universally consistent between OS platforms.
     Issue reported by Al Sterman.
   - Added the '-u' (timestamp check) flag to the rsync downloads so
     that signature databases will not be downloaded from mirrors that
     are out of sync and hosting old files.  Requested by Wolfgang Breyha
   - Added a configuration variable that will provide the ability to
     scan a HAM (non-spam) directory with new signature databases and
     automatically remove signatures that trigger from the database
     before implementing.  Requested by Mike Cardwell.
   - Added the '-t' flag to the script to output third-party signatures
     that trigger during the HAM directory scan, but only if the 'ham_dir'
     variable is enabled in the configuration file and hit were found.
   - Updated required utilities section of the config file.  Requested
     by Micah Anderson.
   - Updated Manual page, README, and INSTALL files.

Version 3.5.4 (updated 2009-06-25)
   - Removed an unnecessary early database reload when a change was
     detected by the script in the local.ign signature bypass file.
   - The script was not properly handling exit status when configured
     with full script output silence and database reloading was
     disabled.  Issue reported by Andreas Prieﬂ.
   - The script was not detecting bypass signature entry changes in
     local.ign if the entry did not include the line number in the
     bypass signature entry.  Issue reported by Paul Enlund.
   - Windows convention is to end each line of text with the carriage
     return character followed by the newline character.  In order to
     work around this, the script now strips the CRLF from the end of
     signature lines before testing for changes, modifications, or
     removal of local.ign bypassed signature entries.  Issue reported
     by Paul Enlund.

Version 3.5.3 (updated 2009-06-04)
   - Replaced 'sed -i' (in-place) 'replace/remove' code in the script
     with similar perl code.  It was determined that sed varies too
     much between OS platforms.  The differences between FBSD, Linux,
     Sun, and HPUX was too problematic to rely on sed for 'in-place'
     editing.  Thanks to Larry Rosenman for testing the new perl code
     sections on all 4 platforms listed above.

Version 3.5.2 (updated 2009-06-04)
   - Renamed the cron and logrotate files, changing the "." to "-" due
     the fact that some platform (such as Debian) have certain naming
     restrictions on cron file names that does not allow for the use of
     a "." in the file name.  The documentation has also been updated.
     Consider renaming your files.  Issue reported by Yizhar Hurwitz.
   - Added the sed "-e" (expression=script) flag to the 4 sed commands
     that use the "-i" (edit in-place) in the script's "-b" (create
     signature bypass) flag.  Apparently without the sed "-e" flag,
     FreeBSD intreprets part of the expanded variable as a command.
     Issue reported by Larry Rosenman.
   - Replaced a misplaced hard link with the appropriate variable in
     the signature bypass section of the script.  Issue reported by
     Larry Rosenman.
   - Added feedback in warning message regarding signature database name
     misspelling as a possible issue when all rsync mirror sites fail.
   - Improved the signature bypass code section that monitors hexadecimal
     signature modifications and removals and keeps local.ign updated.

Version 3.5.1 (updated 2009-05-30)
   - Fixed an issue with the script exiting with an error condition if
     both "clamd_reload" is disabled and all script silence options are
     enabled.  Issue reported by Andreas Prieﬂ.
   - Fixed a /path/file statement that was pointing to a scan test file
     that was used while testing the script and then inadvertently left
     in the released script.  Issue reported by Lukasz Czarnowski.
   - Moved all third-party signature databases labeled as medium and high
     risk (as defined at http://www.sanesecurity.com/clamav/databases.htm)
     into comment sections in the configuration file with a pointer to the
     above URL.  This will require script users to consciously enable the
     usage of these potentially high false-positive risk databases rather
     than have them enabled by default.  Requested by Steve Basford.

Version 3.5 (updated 2009-05-25)
   - Added the '-m' flag that will make a hexadecimal signature database
     file (*.ndb) from a clear text, ascii source file that contains one
     data string entry per line that will then be converted into signature
     lines in the new database file.
   - Added the new INetMsg SpamDomains database to the config file.
   - Updated the INSTALL, README and manual page.

Version 3.4 (updated 2009-05-22)
   - Modified the '-b' (create signature bypass) flag so that the script
     no longer deletes the local.ign file. The script now tracks changes
     to any signature bypass entries it creates in local.ign and will
     remove the signature bypass entry if either the original offending
     third-party signature being bypassed has been modified or has been
     removed from the third-party database.
   - Updated the INSTALL, README and manual page.

Version 3.3 (updated 2009-05-19)
   - Updated the MalwarePatrol URL to now use their new download link.
   - Added a new '-f' flag that can now hexadecimal encode formatted
     input strings containing spacing fields '{}, (), *', without
     encoding the spacing fields.
   - Modified the perl code that hexadecimal encodes and decodes input
     strings so that they are more compact, efficient and the decoding
     will not decode spacer fields containing '{}, (), *'.  Thanks to
     Mark Martinec for his assistence with this.
   - Tightened up a few sections of the script.
   - Updated the INSTALL document and manual page.

Version 3.2 (updated 2009-05-14)
   - Repositioned a badly placed 'echo' command that was causing empty
     cron emails to be sent even if all silence variables were set in
     the config file and no error conditions existed.  Issue reported
     by Andreas Prieﬂ.
   - Added a '-b' switch that can be used to create a bypass signature
     for local.ign in order to temporarily resolve false-positive issues
     with a third-party signature.  The local.ign file will automatically
     be deleted once its timestame shows the last change time to be at
     least 24 hours old.  This is done in order to keep bypass entries
     from becoming stale.
   - Updated the README and INSTALL documents, and the manual page.  Also
     updated the cron file to point the script location to /usr/local/bin/
     instead of /usr/bin/.  This also matches the base path to the config
     file (/usr/local/).

Version 3.1 (updated 2009-05-11)
   - The script now strips all single (') and double (") quote marks
     from input to the '-d' (decode) flag.
   - Added the missing SecruiteInfo '*.gz' files to the list of files
     to be removed from the system with the "-r" (remove) flag or when
     uninstalled via a package manager.  Reported by Paul Wise.

Version 3.0 (updated 2009-05-10)
   - Added a couple of missing stderr redirects.  Reported by Paul Wise.
   - Updated the manual page and README and INSTALL documentation.
   - Added cron and logrotate files to the tarball.
   - Added a '-r' (remove script) flag that will allow the script user
     to easily remove the script and all of its associated files and
     databases and work directories from the system.
   - Provided two variables that package and port maintainers can use in
     order to prevent the script from removing itself with the '-r' flag
     if the script was installed via a package manager like yum, apt, pkg,
     etc.  The script will instead provide feedback to the user about how
     to uninstall the package.
   - Added the ability to disable execution of "chown" (the setting of
     user and group permissions on files and directories) if either the
     "clam_user" or "clam_group" or both variables are commented in the
     config file.  Requested by Micha Lenk
   - The script will now decode input from both third-party signature
     names (e.g.: Sanesecurity.Junk.15248) and hexadecimal encoded strings.
   - The script now supports decoding of third-party signatures that include
     spacing information within the hexadecimal string (e.g.: {-50}) and
     will now output the decode string with the spacing information intact.
   - Added the '-e' (encode) flag that will hexadecimal encode any input
     string and output a hexadecimal string that can be used in any *.ndb
     type signature database.
   - The script will now do a database reload if it detects that signature
     databases have been removed from the configuration file and deleted
     from the system.  It will also report this information via cron email,
     if enabled, and will also write this information to the log file, if
     logging is enabled.

Version 2.8 (updated 2009-05-01)
   - Added file management to the script so package/port maintainers
     can easily uninstall/purge the script's installation.  This
     same "purge.txt" file, which can be found in the script's
     '$config_dir' directory, can also be used by script users to
     manually remove the script and all of its associated files.
   - Added file removal to the script so that legacy databases and
     backup files are completely removed from the file system if
     removed or disabled in the script's configuration file.  Any
     legacy files that reside on the file system prior to using this
     version of the script will need to be removed manually.  This is
     also true if migrating to this script from some other download
     script, due to different file naming conventions.
   - Added support for the rsync "--contimeout" flag, if the local
     rsync client supports this new flag.  This provides a means to
     timeout a connection attempt after some time interval specified
     by the flag (set to 30 seconds in the script) when an rsync server
     is not responding to the connection attempt.
   - Added some additional output for the script's '-g' (GPG signature
     test) and '-s' (clamscan integrity test) flags which will output
     flag specific feedback to the user and provide for an easy way
     to copy/paste valid databases that can be tested with each flag.
   - The script's '-d' (decode virus signature) flag will now also
     output what database the virus signature was found in.
   - If the script is run in silent mode, it now silences all rsync
     error conditions and will only output error information if all
     rsync mirror connection attempts fail.  Therefore, when running
     silent via cron, the script will not report an rsync connection
     failure as long as the script was able to successfully connect
     to an alternate mirror.  If script logging is enabled, all rsync
     connection information will still be written to the log file.
   - Added support for the new Sanesecurity 'jurlbla.ndb' database.
   - Added manual page written by Paul Wise <pabs@debian.org>, for the
     Debian project.

Version 2.7.3 (updated 2009-04-25)
   - Added error checking to GPG signature tests and will now fall-back
     and retest using different parameters if an error is detected.
   - Added error checking to "find" command and will now fall-back and
     try several alternatives (from most favorable to least favorable)
     until the command is run successfully.
   - Removed the rsync "-r" (recurse into directories) flag since we
     don't need it, as the script only syncs with those files that
     have been specifically defined if the '--files-from' file.
   - Changed the script's '-d' flag to '-i', to "Output system and
     configuration information".
   - The script's '-d' flag will now 'decode' ClamAV 'UNOFFICIAL'
     3rd-Party signatures for viewing.  The script will NOT decode
     image signatures (for obvious reasons), nor ClamAV 'OFFICIAL'
     signatures, due to the various signature formats.

Version 2.7.2 (update 2009-04-23)
   - ***** ALERT - ALERT - ALERT - ALERT - ALERT - ALERT - ALERT *****
     The script name has been changed.  This has been done to facilitate
     packaging and redistribution of the scripts by various OS package
     and port maintainers.  By renaming the script and tarball from
     "unofficial-clamav-sigs" to "clamav-unofficial-sigs", the package
     will show up when using package managers like yum, apt, pkg, etc.,
     to install ClamAV and its supporting and complementary packages.
     Please be sure to make the necessary changes to your cron jobs to
     support the new script and config file names.
   - Added the new Winnow (winnow_spam_complete.ndb) and Sanesecurity
     (jurlbl.ndb) database files.
   - Added a safety net to all "rm" commands in the script in order to
     prevent script config file editing errors that could potentially
     cause deletion of unintended files and/or directories.  Thanks to
     Mike Cappella for suggesting this.
   - Modified the script's "getopts" section logic to make it more
     efficient and easier to understand.  Thanks to Mike Cappella for
     his comments and suggestions in this area.

Version 2.7.1 (updated 2009-04-17)
   - Fixed a bug in the output of the script's '-s' flag (clamscan
     database integrity test), which would always erroneously output
     'scam.ndb' as the database file being tested.
   - Added missing 'curl_proxy' variable to the Sanesecurity GPG Key
     download section.
   - Added an open-source license so that OS package maintainers can
     package the scripts for redistribution.
   - A duplicate tarball with the version number included in the file
     name is now also located in the download directory.  This is done
     so that package maintainers can easily determine if an update has
     been released.

Version 2.7 (updated 2009-03-31)
  - Added new signature database options:
       winnow_malware.hdb
       winnow_phish_complete.ndb
       winnow_phish_complete_url.ndb
    See the "unofficial-clamav-sigs.conf" file for usage information.
  - Revised the email report output of the SecruiteInfo update checks.
  - Minor modifications to the script's email report comments.
  - Minor change to the rsync update checks (using "--files-from=FILE"
    instead of "--include-from=FILE", and therefore no longer needing
    to use "--exclude=PATTERN").  This also configures rsync to report
    in its output the exact number of files it is checking for updates.
  - Apparently there's a problem with some versions of "xargs" causing
    the script to report "chmod: missing operand after `0644'" when used 
    with the "find" command.  The script has been changed to now use
    "-exec chmod 0644 {} +" instead of "xargs -0 chmod 0644", which is
    hopefully more widely supported.  Reported by Chris Kuhles.
  - Minor update to INSTALL document to make the instructions flow more
    logically.  Reported by Anthony Cartmell.

Version 2.6 (updated 2009-03-25)
  - The script will now try alternate rsync mirror sites if a site fails
    for any reason, and will continue trying alternate mirror sites until
    either successful or all mirror sites have failed.  The script will
    also report and log all failed attempts.  This is only applicable to
    Sanesecurity and MSRBL, as these are currently the only two signature
    providers that use rsync and provide multiple mirror site locations.
  - Changed permissions on gpg_dir from 0600 to 0700, as the execute bit
    is necessary for access to this directory, with the exception being
    the root account on some distros.  Reported by Jernej Porenta.
  - Corrected a typo in the GPG Signature verify example in the INSTALL
    file.  It should have been: "unofficial-clamav-sigs.sh -g filename",
    not "-c".  Reported by Jernej Porenta.

Version 2.5 (updated 2009-03-20)
  - Changed permissions on gpg_dir from 0644 to 0600, otherwise GPG will
    report: "WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir...".
  - Added "--exclude=*.gz" to the user defined "add_dbs" rsync downloads
    to prevent compressed files from being downloaded from local mirrors.
    Requested by Jim Lohiser.
  - Added comments to the config file with recommendations for specific
    shell options for different OS platforms, as well as additional path
    statement instructions.  This information is based off of feedback
    from various script users.  Suggested by Jeff Earickson.
  - Updated the INSTALL document to include information about defining
    the correct shell and path settings for different OS platforms.
  - Updated some script comments to make them more applicable with
    recent script updates.
  - It's recommended that rsync version 2.6.9 or newer is used, as older
    versions do not support the '--no-motd' flag.  This is not an issue,
    as the flag is disabled if it's not supported.  However, if the
    "rsync_silence" variable is not being used, the output will contain
    any "message of the day" text that is presented by the rsync mirror
    site being used for the update check.
  - Changed "$1" to "${@:-}" in the "comment" and "log" functions in
    order to prevent otherwise potentially puzzling errors.  This was
    recommended by Charles Seeger.

Version 2.4 (updated 2009-03-15)
  - Expanded the script's '-h' help and usage information output.
  - Added the following script flags:
    '-d'  output system & configuration information for debug purposes
    '-g'  gpg signature test a specific Sanesecurity database file
    '-s'  clamscan integrity test a specific database file
  - Split the scripts RSYNC_PROXY 'PATH' and 'EXPORT' statements
    onto 2 separate lines.

Version 2.3 (updated 2009-03-13)
  - Broke the PATH and EXPORT statements into two separate lines.
    Apparently some shells do not like "export PATH" on one line.
  - Added some perl based reload options for those that want to
    signal the clamd socket to do a reload after database updates
    but do not have socat installed on their systems.  Also added
    socat and perl reload options for those running clamd with a
    tcp socket versus a local unix socket.
  - Modified help (-h) output and also provide better error handling.
  - Updated comments and logging to better reflect script changes.
  - Added comments and logging so as to provide better information
    about how the script ran.
  - Reconfigured GPG key handling and signature verifying.  This will
    hopefully resolve the issue that some have been experiencing with
    GPG signature tests failing when run via cron.
  - The script now does a "chmod 0644" of the $work_dir to set access
    permissions to "-rw-r--r--" on all $work_dir files.
  - Rearranged the clamd status tests in both unofficial-clamav-sig.sh
    and clamd-status.sh scripts to run perl socket tests first, as it
    has been reported that the soon to be release ClamAV version 0.95
    may not respond to a socat PING with the requisite PONG on some
    OSs, thereby causing the script to erroneously report clamd as not
    running and attempting to restart it.  It has also been reported
    that adding a pause to the socat test seems to resolve the issue,
    so the pause has also been added to the script, as well.
  - Added the "-T" (enable TCP/IP mode) flag to the "host" lookups, as
    Patrick Cernko reported that without enabling tcp mode, that the
    response exceeded the maximum data that can be stored in a UDP
    packet. This was causing the "host" binary to report: "Truncated,
    retrying in TCP mode".
  - Added "rsync_proxy" and "curl_proxy" variables so that users that
    need to proxy their rsync and/or curl database downloads can now
    define them in the configuration file instead of having to edit the
    script itself.  Requested by Fl·vio do Carmo J˙nior.

Version 2.2 (updated 2009-03-07)
  - Updated logging identifications (INFO, WARNING, ALERT, CRITICAL) so
    that logged events are more appropriately labeled.
  - Now using "checksum" with rsync to determine whether files have been
    updated instead of "timestamp/file-size", which has been shown to be
    unreliable with Sanesecurity files (although this may be resolved
    now).  Also using "checksum" update verification  with MSRBL files,
    as well.  Currently, all Sanesecurity and MSRBL mirror sites support
    "checksum" file change testing.
  - Switched from "diff" to "cmp" to check whether downloaded database
    files are different then those running in production.  Apparently
    "cmp" is more portable across platforms then "diff".  This keeps
    the script from unnecessarily reloading ClamD's databases when no
    file changes are detected.
  - Now logging rsync and curl connection/download failures.
  - Now using rsync to update files in production instead of copy/move
    that was used previously.  The script also no longer uses temp_dir.
  - Created a variable option that allows users to add database sites.
    This will also allow users that have many local servers using third
    party (unofficial) signature databases to create a local mirror so
    that the files can be downloaded once and all other servers update
    via the local mirror.  Supports rsync and all download protocols
    supported by curl (see "man curl" for supported protocols).
  - The script has been consolidated and tighten as unnecessary routines
    have been removed and additional logic implemented to reduce size.

Version 2.1b (updated 2009-02-26)
  - Changed MalwarePatrol database download from using older .db format
    to the newer .ndb format.
  - Check to see if the older mbl.db and mbl.db-bak files exist, and if
    so, delete them at the next MalwarePatrol database download of the
    newer mbl.ndb database file format.
  - Added another database reload option for those that have "socat"
    installed on their systems.
  - If "enable_random" is enabled in the script, then the pause time
    is now written to the log file.
  - Minor comment and logging info cleanup.
  - Updated README and INSTALL documents.
  - Added a logging option to the clamd-status.sh script.

Version 2.1a (updated 2009-02-21)
  - Implemented patch to create functions for silencing comments and
    for logging as provided by Panagiotis Christias.
  - Moved the section that tests for whether the script is being run
    from the console or via cron to the top and removed the prompt
    when run manually from the console.  Also enabled all script
    script output to screen when run manually.
  - Changed MalwarePatrol URL from IP address back to www.malware.com.br
    (this was an oversight leftover from testing).
  - Added code to the unofficial-clamav-sigs.sh and clamd-status.sh scripts
    to delete any orphaned daemon process files (pid, lock, socket) before
    attempting to start ClamD after a crash.

Version 2.1 (updated 2009-02-20)
  - Provided a default location for the script's configuration file.
    Now the script can be run either with the "-c" flag, or without any
    flag, as long as the config file resides in the /etc directory.
    If you feel compelled to change the default config file location,
    it is the first variable located near the top of the script file.
  - Several people have requested logging capabilities.  The samples
    that have been provided used the OS's logging facility.  I didn't
    want to clutter up the "messages" or "maillog" with output from the
    script, so I've instead implemented more rudimentary logging that
    writes its output to a user defined log file.
  - Others have requested the ability to completely silence the script's
    output so that when run via cron, no emails are generated except
    when an error condition has been reported.  This has now been done.
  - Some additional script logic corrections and code cleanup have also
    been made in this update.

Version 2.0c (updated 2009-02-12)
  - Separated the script into 3 files, Script, Config, & Changelog.
    Now users will no longer have to update the user configuration
    section of the script every time the script is updated.
  - Removed the redirect of STDERR to /dev/null for the shell's
    RANDOM test since it's not necessary there.
  - Created a separate clamd status and restart script.  The code
    section still remains in unofficial-clamav-sigs.sh script, as
    well, but can be disabled there if a user wants to run status
    checks more often then signature database downloads.

Version 2.0b (updated 2/10/09)
  - Added a "diff" test that is run prior to moving a new database file
    into the clamav directory.  If there is no difference between the 2
    database files, then the script will report that it's testing the
    updated (but unchanged) database file.  Processing of the database
    file will still continue so that the file timestamps stay synced.
    This test was added because it's been noted that some database files
    are repeatedly being download, even when nothing has changed.  This
    test will assist in tracking down this issue.
  - Added a variable to silence the gpg output (based on a request from
    Steffen Ille).
  - Added a variable to silence most of the scripts text output.  When
    all "silence" variables are enabled, the script will only output the
    database provider section headers, any error output from the GPG
    Signature verification tests and Clamscan database integrity tests,
    and whether updates were detected and clamd reload or not.
  - Corrected some script logic errors and missing (parenthesis) around
    some of the "test" command lines.

Version 2.0a (updated 2/8/09)
  - Moved all SecuriteInfo *.gz files out of the clam_dbs directory and
    placed them instead into the si_dirs directory.  Also moved the MBL and
    SecuriteInfo timestamp files (last-*-update.txt) out of the clam_dbs
    directory and placed them into the config_dir (based on suggestions
    from Panagiotis Christias).
  - Added a variable about whether to create a backup database file before
    moving an updated database file into the clam_dbs directory (based on
    suggestions from Panagiotis Christias).
  - Added a check to confirm that the local SecuriteInfo .gz file exists
    before doing an "rsync -z" (time condition) test against the remote
    rsync server's file.
  - Added a check to test that the uncompressed SecuriteInfo database files
    exist, are greater than zero, and are newer than the existing database
    files before proceeding with further database testing and processing.
  - Added a check to test that the MalwarePatrol database file exists,
    is greater than zero, and is newer than the existing database file
    before proceeding with further database testing and processing.
  - Changed "test_dir" to "temp_dir" since we no longer test database files
    in this directory.  It is now only used as a temporary location for
    copying files to before moving them into the clam_dbs directory.
  - Database files for all unofficial database providers are now kept in
    their working sub-directories.  The only directory that remains empty
    between updates now is the temp_dir directory.

Version 2.0 (update 2/6/09)
  - Added some missing variable quotes and also added some additional
    checks to confirm which database providers and database files to
    update (based on suggestions from Alex Pleiner).
  - Major rearrangement of the scripts layout in order to make the flow
    more logical.  Also consolidated some of the functions and variable
    names so they could be reused in different parts of the script.
  - Added a time variable to the SecuriteInfo checks so that the update
    checks could be configured on an hourly or daily basis (based on
    request from Bill Maidment).
  - Removed use of "." to define the current directory and instead used
    absolute path.  This also removed the requirement for the shell to
    cd into the clamav directory.

Version 1.9d (updated 2/5/09)
  - Added variable "reload_dbs" to enable/disable database reloads after
    a database has been updated.
  - Added variable "reload_opt" to select or set how to reload the
    databases after an update, if "reload_dbs" variable is set to "yes"
    (based on request from Bob Hutchinson).

Version 1.9c (updated 2/4/09)
  - Added missing "&&" operators to the rsync download sections of the
    script (thanks to Paul Henson for catching this).

Version 1.9b (updated 2/4/09)
  - Changed final directory permissions execution from "chmod 0664" to
    "chmod u+Xrw" so as not to change sub-directory permissions (based
    on recommendation from Daniel McDonald).
  - Consolidated working directory path to a single variable to simplify
    script directory location changes (based on request from Justin Davis).
  - Changed clamd database reload command from "kill -USR2 `cat $clamd_pid`"
    to "clamdscan --reload" (inspired by Malcolm Scott).
  - Inadvertently removed a script line from the rsync download section
    that saved a backup copy of the running database file before the
    database was updated - it's now been re-added.

Version 1.9a (updated 2/4/09)
  - Added variable to silence rsync output, as already done for curl
    (based on request from Daniel McDonald).
  - Changed the rsync "-a" (archive) flag to "-rt" in order to ignore
    source ownership & permission settings when files are downloaded
    (based on feedback from Jeff Dairiki).

Version 1.9 (updated 2/3/09) - Thanks to Jeff Dairiki & Steve Basford for
their suggestions of using "--include-from=FILE" and "--exclude=PATTERN"
with rsync to control database file downloads via a single connection.
  - Rewrote Sanesecurity and MSRBL rsync sections.  Now all user specified
    databases will be downloaded over a single connection.
  - Script output will now show which Sanesecurity and MSRBL mirror the
    connection was made to.
  - Script output will also show the success or failure of GPG signature
    testing and clamscan database integrity testing for each updated file.
  - Database files now have permissions set (chmod & chown) before they
    are moved into the clamav working directory.  A final check is also
    still done at the end of the script, as well.
  - Some variable names have changed or been removed, as well as some
    directory paths added, removed, or changed to better accomodate single
    rsync connection downloads, so carefully review the user configuration
    section before using the script.

Version 1.8a (updated 2/1/09)
  - Added Sanesecurity.ftm & Sanesecurity.ftm.sig to the Sanesecurity
    rsync database downloads (this helps clamav determine the signature
    type to use when scanning email files).
  - Added output for GPG signature test results (reports good or bad
    GPG signature test results).
  - If using clamd daemon monitoring and crash restart, added a check
    to see if clamd's lock file still exists after the crash and deletes
    it if it does (the orphaned clamd lock file can sometimes prevent
    clamd from restarting after a crash has occurred).

Version 1.8 (updated 1/21/09)
  - Changed Sanesecurity downloads from using curl to rsync.
  - Automatically download and import Sanesecurity GPG key to keyring.
  - Automatically download, and check for updated Sanesecurity GPG
    Signature files.
  - Test Sanesecurity database downloads against GPG Signature files
    before integrity testing databases with clamscan.  If either test
    fails, that database file will not be updated.
  - Added and modified working directory paths to better accommodate
    gpg Signature testing.

Version 1.7d (updated 10/5/08 - Thanks to Burt Heymanson for his
contribution to this update - silence curl output)
  - Added 2 new Sanesecurity databases: junk.ndb & rogue.hdb.
  - Added a configuration option to silence curl output to only report
    errors to stderr rather than all download stats.

Version 1.7c (updated 9/25/07 - Thanks to Dennis Peterson and Jan-Perter
Cornet for the perl solution for calculating seconds since epoch)
  - Added timeout values to curl and rsync downloads in order to prevent
    the script from hanging on a non-responsive host site.
  - Apparently Solaris does not support "date +%s", which calculates
    the number of seconds since epoch.  This date function is used to
    calculate when to do MBL downloads.  A perl solution has been added
    as a fall-back option.  If "date +%s" is not supported and perl is
    not found on the system, the script will report a warning message
    and skip MBL updates, but the script will continue processing other
    third-party database updates.

Version 1.7b (updated 9/23/07)
  - Changed all script "`expr ...`" interger expressions to the shell
    supported "$((...))" format, which is what was being used in all
    other newer sections of the script.  So this change should not
    pose any problems, but if it does, please let me know.
  - Changed all clamscan database file tests from using /dev/null,
    which was causing an access permissions issues to the temporary
    directory for some users, to a direct path to a temp test file.

Version 1.7a (updated 9/10/07)
  - Added secondary perl socket test to detect if clamd is running.
    This test uses the 'IO::Socket::UNIX' perl module.  If socat is
    not found on the system, then the script will attempt to use the
    perl module instead (the user will be warned if neither socat nor
    IO::Socket::UNIX are found, but the script will still run updates).
  - Added two new SecuriteInfo database file URLs.
  - Updated comments to reflect the additional perl socket test.

Version 1.7 (updated 9/7/07)
  - Added a check to see if ClamD is running or not.  This can be used
    if clamd is running in "LocalSocket" mode (*NOT* TCP/IP mode), and
    socat is installed on the system (a check for socat is done).  This
    test can be enabled in the "User Edit" section below.
  - Added a user configurable variable to attempt to restart clamd if
    it's detected to not be running.
  - Added notification when database file updates are *NOT* detected and
    databases are *NOT* reloaded, rather than just when they are detected.
  - Added more portable secondary randomization code, removing the
    requirement to have the bash shell installed.
  - Added general improvements to the time randomization code so that
    the time interval does not always end with a zero.
  - Added user configurable min and max variables for setting time
    randomization intervals (defaults to min=60 and max=600 seconds).
  - Added terminal detection to determine whether the script is being
    run manually or via cron.  If run manually, the script will now
    prompt the user to see if they want to delay the script execution
    (random) or not.  If "yes" is selected, then the script will pause
    and display a visual countdown in seconds until script execution.
  - Added a variable that the user must set before the script will run.
    This will effectively require that script users at least minimally
    review the "User Edit Section" before running the script.
  - Rearranged some sections, timestame placement, and updated comments.

Version 1.6 (updated 8/27/07)
  - Added support for SecuriteInfo and Malware Black List
    database file downloads.
  - Changed the script name from ss-msrbl.sh to unofficial-sigs.sh
    since there are now 4 different database providers supported.
  - Since the MBL database is dynamically created and therefor
    cannot be checked for change before downloading, a variable was
    added so that a specific download time interval can be set (see
    the "USER EDIT SECTION" below).
  - Added database file download time randomization (to disable
    randomization, see the "USER EDIT SECTION" below for details).

Version 1.5 (updated 8/17/07 - Thanks to Dan Larsson for his
contributions to this update)
  - Added separate variable for ClamAV group ID for setting
    appropriate file group access permissions.
  - Added variables for database file update URLs.
  - Added support for automatic reloading of databases when
    updates are found.

Version 1.4 (updated 7/13/07)
  - Added checks to verify that the database files exist,
    and if not, do an initial download, decompress and test.
  - Added variables for clamav database location path and
    clamd user account (the account that clamd runs under).
  - Added/modified script comments.

Version 1.3
  - Added checks to either confirm the existence of the
    temporary working directories or to create them.
  - Changed "cp --reply=yes" to "cp -f".  If this
    causes problems with older versions of "cp",
    you will need to change it back.

Version 1.2
  - Repointed URLs for Sanesecurity downloads to
    the new mirror redirect links.

Version 1.1
  - Converted MSRBL downloads from curl to rsync.

Version 1.0 (initial script created).
