Script provide by Bill Landry (unofficialsigs@gmail.com).

## Description
The clamav-unofficial-sigs script provides a simple way to download, test, and update third-party 
signature databases provided by Sanesecurity, FOXHOLE, OITC, Scamnailer, BOFHLAND, CRDF, Porcupine, 
Securiteinfo, MalwarePatrol. The package also contains cron, logrotate, and man files.

The two files needed to download, test and update third-party ClamAV database files are the script itself
(clamav-unofficial-sig.sh), and the user configuration file (clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf).

Since the user configuration section has been separated from the script itself, the script now
needs to reference the configuration file when run by using the "-c" flag when running the script.
It is also recommended that a copy of the configuration file be place in the "default" location
"/etc" so that it can be used when running the script manually without using the "-c" flag, or
when running the script with the "-d" (decode virus signature), "-g" (check gpg signature), or
"-s" (check database integrity) flags.  This also provides a way to run the script with different
configuration options when run via cron versus when run manually.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================

WARNING:  Renaming any of the files included in the tarball may cause the script to fail to remove
all files, databases, and work directories from the system if the '-r' (remove script) flag is used.

Make sure you do not have the package installed via yum/apt
  Debian/Ubuntu:
    apt-get purge clamav-unofficial-sigs
  RHEL/CentOS:
    yum purge clamav-unofficial-sigs
    
Download the latest archive
  wget -q --no-check-certificate https://github.com/extremeshok/clamav-unofficial-sigs/archive/master.zip -O /tmp/clamav-unofficial-sigs.zip 

Uncompress/Unpackage the archive:
   unzip -j -qq -o /tmp/clamav-unofficial-sigs.zip -d /tmp/clamav-unofficial-sigs/

Install:
   mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
   mkdir -p /var/log/clamav-unofficial-sigs/
   cp -f /tmp/clamav-unofficial-sigs/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh /usr/local/sbin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh
   chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh

   cp -f /tmp/clamav-unofficial-sigs/clamav-unofficial-sigs-logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/clamav-unofficial-sigs-logrotate   

Configure:
   Edit the /etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf file
   Edit the /etc/logrotate.d/clamav-unofficial-sigs-logrotate file
   
IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Make sure that the PATH statement correctly defines the location of your binary files.  These
     include: find, sed, awk, cut, grep, tail, chown, chmod, cmp, diff, dig, host, gzip, ls, cp, mv,
     test, gpg, xargs, sleep, urandom, cksum, rsync, curl, socat, etc.  It has been reported that
     on Sun systems, the GNU utilities should be used rather than the default Sun versions.
   - System shell setting:  Based on user feedback, it has been reported that "sh" works best for
     BSD variants, "ksh" for Sun Solaris, and "bash" for Linux variants.  If you experience problems
     running the script, please try editing the top line of the script file and changing "sh" to
     either "ksh" or "bash" before reporting a problem.
   - Adjust configuration settings to meet your system requirements.

===================
SCRIPT FLAGS USAGE:
===================

Usage: clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh [OPTION] [PATH|FILE]

-c, --config    Direct script to use a specific configuration file
        eg: '-c /path/to/clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf'
        Optional if the default config is available
        Default: /etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf
	
--force         Force all databases to be downloaded, could cause ip to be blocked

-h, --help      Display this script's help and usage information

-v, --version   Output script version and date information

-d, --decode-sig        Decode a third-party signature either by signature name
        (eg: Sanesecurity.Junk.15248) or hexadecimal string.
        This flag will 'NOT' decode image signatures

-e, --encode-string     Hexadecimal encode an entire input string that can
        be used in any '*.ndb' signature database file

-f, --encode-formatted  Hexadecimal encode a formatted input string containing
        signature spacing fields '{}, (), *', without encoding
        the spacing fields, so that the encoded signature
        can be used in any '*.ndb' signature database file

-g, --gpg-verify        GPG verify a specific Sanesecurity database file
        eg: '-g filename.ext' (do not include file path)

-i, --information       Output system and configuration information for
        viewing or possible debugging purposes

-m, --make-database     Make a signature database from an ascii file containing
        data strings, with one data string per line.  Additional
        information is provided when using this flag

-r, --remove-script     Remove the clamav-unofficial-sigs script and all of
        its associated files and databases from the system

-s, --test-database     Clamscan integrity test a specific database file
        eg: '-s filename.ext' (do not include file path)

-t, --output-triggered  If HAM directory scanning is enabled in the script's
        configuration file, then output names of any third-party
        signatures that triggered during the HAM directory scan

-w, --whitelist Adds a signature whitelist entry in the newer ClamAV IGN2
        format to 'my-whitelist.ign2' in order to temporarily resolve
        a false-positive issue with a specific third-party signature.
        Script added whitelist entries will automatically be removed
        if the original signature is either modified or removed from
        the third-party signature database

--check-clamav  If ClamD status check is enabled and the socket path is correctly specified
        then test to see if clamd is running or not
