# place of the "FILE-NAME" to download all files from specified location,
# but this *ONLY* works for files downloaded via rsync).  For non-rsync
# downloads, curl is used.  For download protocols supported by curl, see
# "man curl".  This also works well for locations that have many ClamAV
# servers that use 3rd party signature databases, as only one server need
# download the remote databases, and all others can update from the local
# mirrors copy.  See format examples below.  To use, remove the comments
# and examples shown and add your own sites between the quote marks.
