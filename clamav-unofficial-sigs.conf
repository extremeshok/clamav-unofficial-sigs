# Edit the quoted variables below to meet your own particular needs
# and requirements, but do not remove the "quote" marks.

# Be sure to set the appropriate shell for your OS Platform.  It's been
# reported that "sh" works best for BSD variants, "ksh" for Sun Solaris,
# and "bash" for Linux variants.  If you experience problems running the
# script, please try editing the top line of the script file and changing
# "sh" to either "ksh" or "bash" before reporting a problem.

# Set and export the appropriate program paths for your OS platform.  Required
# utilities include: find, xargs, sed, awk, cut, dig, grep, tail, chown, chmod,
# cmp, diff, gzip, ls, cp, mv, test, gpg, host, sleep, cksum, rsync, curl, perl,
# and optionally socat.  It's been reported that on Sun systems, the GNU utilities
# should be used rather than the default Sun OS versions of these utilities.

PATH="/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin"
export PATH

# Set the appropriate ClamD user and group accounts for your system.
# If you do not want the script to set user and group permissions on
# files and directories, comment the next two variables.
clam_user="clamav"
clam_group="clamav"

# If you do not want the script to change the file mode of all signature
# database files in the ClamAV working directory to 0644 (-rw-r--r--):
#
# owner: read, write
# group: read
# world: read
#
# as defined in the "clam_dbs" path variable below, then set the following
# "setmode" variable to "no".
setmode="yes"

# Set path to ClamAV database files location.  If unsure, check
# your clamd.conf file for the "DatabaseDirectory" path setting.
clam_dbs="/var/lib/clamav"

# Set path to clamd.pid file (see clamd.conf for path location).
clamd_pid="/var/run/clamd.pid"

# To enable "ham" (non-spam) directory scanning and removal of
# signatures that trigger on ham messages, uncomment the following
# variable and set it to the appropriate ham message directory.
#ham_dir="/path/to/ham-test/directory"

# If you would like to reload the clamd databases after an update,
# change the following variable to "yes".
reload_dbs="no"

# Set the reload or restart option if the "reload_dbs" variable above
# is set to "yes" (only select 'ONE' of the following variables or the
# last uncommented variable option will be the one used).
# - The next variable signals clamd daemon to reload databases (this is the recommended reload option)
reload_opt="clamdscan --reload"  # Default
# - The next variable signals clamd's Process ID (PID) to reload databases
#reload_opt="kill -USR2 `cat $clamd_pid`"
# - The next variable signals linux based systems to do a full clamd service stop/start
#reload_opt="service clamd restart"
# - Use the next variable to set a custom or system specific reload/restart option
#reload_opt=""

# If running clamd in "LocalSocket" mode (*NOT* in TCP/IP mode), and
# either "SOcket Cat" (socat) or the "IO::Socket::UNIX" perl module
# are installed on the system, and you want to report whether clamd
# is running or not, uncomment the "clamd_socket" variable below (you
# will be warned if neither socat nor IO::Socket::UNIX are found, but
# the script will still run).  You will also need to set the correct
# path to your clamd socket file (if unsure of the path, check the
# "LocalSocket" setting in your clamd.conf file for socket location).
#clamd_socket="/var/run/clamd.socket"

# If you would like to attempt to restart ClamD if detected not running,
# uncomment the next 2 lines.  Confirm the path to the "clamd_lock" file
# (usually can be found in the clamd init script) and also enter the clamd
# start command for your particular distro for the "start_clamd" variable
# (the sample start command shown below should work for most linux distros).
# NOTE: these 2 variables are dependant on the "clamd_socket" variable
# shown above - if not enabled, then the following 2 variables will be
# ignored, whether enabled or not.
#clamd_lock="/var/lock/subsys/clamd"
#start_clamd="service clamd start"

# Enable or disable download time randomization.  This allows the script to
# be executed via cron, but the actual database file checking will pause
# for a random number of seconds between the "min" and "max" time settings
# specified below.  This helps to more evenly distribute load on the host
# download sites.  To disable, set the following variable to "no".
enable_random="yes"

# If download time randomization is enabled above (enable_random="yes"),
# then set the min and max radomization time intervals (in seconds).
min_sleep_time="60"    # Default minimum is 60 seconds (1 minute).
max_sleep_time="600"   # Default maximum is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

# ========================
# Sanesecurity Database(s)
# ========================
# Add or remove database file names between quote marks as needed.  To
# disable usage of any of the Sanesecurity distributed database files
# shown, remove the database file name from the quoted section below.
# To disable usage of all Sanesecurity distributed databases, comment
# all of the quoted lines below.  Only databases defined as "low" risk
# have been enabled by default (for additional information about the
# database ratings, see: http://www.sanesecurity.com/clamav/databases.htm).
# Only add signature databases here that are "distributed" by Sanesecuirty
# as defined at the URL shown above.  Database distributed by others sources
# (e.g., SecuriteInfo & MalewarePatrol, can be added to other sections of
# this config file below).  Finally, make sure that the database names are
# spelled correctly or you will experience issues when the script runs
# (hint: all rsync servers will fail to download signature updates).

# =========================
# MalwarePatrol Database(s)
# =========================
# Add or remove database file names between quote marks as needed.  To
# disable any of the MalwarePatrol database file downloads, remove the
# appropriate database file name lines below.  To disable MalwarePatrol
# database downloads, comment all of the following lines.
mbl_dbs="

# Since the MalwarePatrol database file is dynamically created,
# there is no way to test for changes prior to downloading.  For this
# reason, you will need to set a reasonable time interval in "hours"
# for MBL database file downloads.  As shown below, this has been
# set to update every "6" hours, which seems appropriate (that's 4
# file downloads per day)  Change only if you REALLY feel you must.
# However, I would not suggest going below every 4 hour lest you risk
# being blacklisted by the MalwarePatrol site.
mbl_update_hours="6"   # Default is 6 hours (4 downloads daily).

# Additional signature databases can be specified here in the following
# format: PROTOCOL://URL-or-IP/PATH/TO/FILE-NAME (use a trailing "/" in
# place of the "FILE-NAME" to download all files from specified location,
# but this *ONLY* works for files downloaded via rsync).  For non-rsync
# downloads, curl is used.  For download protocols supported by curl, see
# "man curl".  This also works well for locations that have many ClamAV
# servers that use 3rd party signature databases, as only one server need
# download the remote databases, and all others can update from the local
# mirror's copy.  See format examples below.  To use, remove the comments
# and examples shown and add your own sites between the quote marks.
