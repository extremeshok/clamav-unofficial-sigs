# have been enabled by default (for additional information about the
# database ratings, see: http://www.sanesecurity.com/clamav/databases.htm).
# Only add signature databases here that are "distributed" by Sanesecuirty
# as defined at the URL shown above.  Database distributed by others sources
# (e.g., SecuriteInfo & MalewarePatrol, can be added to other sections of
# this config file below).  Finally, make sure that the database names are
# spelled correctly or you will experience issues when the script runs

# download sites.  To disable, set the following variable to "no".
enable_random="yes"
